# portfolio
This site was inspired by the design and structure of Keita Yamada portfolio. I really appreciate their work and used some of the elements as inspiration for my own project. The code and content were hand-written, reflecting my own style and ideas.
The goal is to learn, develop skills, and create my own unique presentation.
